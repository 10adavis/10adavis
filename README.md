### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Andrew! 
I'm a senior scientist at Unilever currently working as a bioinformatician. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently developing and utilizing pipelines for the analysis of large biological datasets, including transcriptomic, epigenetic, and proteomic data to derive greater biological understanding. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to analyze single cell RNA-seq datasets using the Seurat suite of software tools in R.
