### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Andrew! 
ðŸ”¬ I'm a bioinformatician with a passion for uncovering the intricate genetic and molecular mechanisms that underpin life itself. I'm enthusiastic about the remarkable advances in biomolecular technology, computational resources, algorithm development, and machine learning, all of which promise to revolutionize our understanding of biology.

ðŸ§¬ My journey in bioinformatics has taken me across diverse research landscapes. I've explored the intricate world of molecular biology, delved into the complexities of cancer biology, ventured into the fascinating realm of dermatology and skin care technology, and examined the science of aging and longevity. This wide-ranging experience has equipped me with a unique perspective on life sciences and technology.

ðŸ’¡ Currently, I'm deeply immersed in the world of cutting-edge bioinformatics. My work involves analyzing single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data, unlocking the secrets held within individual cells. Additionally, I'm engaged in multiomic analysis methods, including Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). These methodologies provide powerful insights into complex biological systems and help us decode the intricate orchestra of life at a molecular level.

ðŸ¤– Beyond my work in bioinformatics, I hold a profound interest in science and technology in general. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has always fascinated me, and, I must admit, I find it both incredibly useful and somewhat terrifying in its implications for our future as a society. In fact, I find myself using AI tools quite frequently now, all while contemplating the exciting and challenging paths it presents to us as a civilization.
