### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Andrew! 
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a bioinformatician, and I'm interested in studying the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms that make life possible. In my opinion the massive advances in biomolecular technology, computational resources, algorithm development, and machine learning will continue to greatly improve our understanding of biology. I'm currently using next generation sequencing techniques to answer questions of human biology. A major part of this effort consists of developing and utilizing pipelines for the analysis of large biological datasets, including transcriptomic, epigenetic, and proteomic data to derive greater biological understanding. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to analyze single cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics datasets in R.
